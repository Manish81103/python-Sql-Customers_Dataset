# __Customer Dataset Analysis Project__

# __Overview__
This project focuses on analyzing customer data using SQL and Python. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains seven related tables: customers, sellers, payments, geolocation, orders, order items, and products. The analysis is conducted in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging SQL for querying and Python for data manipulation and visualization.



# __Project Workflow__

### __1.Data Acquisition:__
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains seven different tables, each representing different aspects of the customer journey, including orders, payments, and geolocation.

### __Data Loading:__
The data was imported into SQL using Python (via Pandas and SQLAlchemy libraries). SQL was used to create the necessary tables and load the data for analysis.

### __Data Analysis:__
SQL queries were written in Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze the data. This involved complex joins across multiple tables, filtering, grouping, and aggregating the data to gain insights into customer behavior and sales trends.

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) was used for data manipulation and to represent the results graphically.

### __Key Insights:__
__i__. Customer purchasing trends based on geography (geolocation analysis).

__ii__. Seller performance and analysis of order items and products.

__iii__. Payment trends, including payment methods and amounts.

__iv__. Order trends and delivery patterns based on geolocation and seller information.

### __Visualization:__
__Programming Languages:__ Python, SQL

__Libraries:__ Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

__Database__: SQL (SQLite / MySQL)

__Development Environment:__ Jupyter Notebook

__Data Source:__ Kaggle

# __Libraries Used__
__i. Pandas:__ Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling data frames.

__ii. Seaborn:__ Used for creating advanced visualizations and statistical plots.

__iii. Matplotlib:__ Used for basic plotting and creating visual representations of the data.


# __Project Structure__
__data/:__ Contains the original dataset in CSV format.

__notebooks/:__ Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data analysis, including SQL queries and visualizations.

__readme.md:__ This file, providing an overview of the project.
# __How to Run the Project__
__i__. Clone this repository to your local machine.

__ii__. Install required Python libraries by running: pip install -r requirements.txt.

__iii__. Set up the SQL database by running the provided SQL scripts or by executing the notebooks/data_loading.ipynb notebook to load the data into the SQL database.

__iv__. Open notebooks/analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
# __Future Enhancements__
Perform advanced predictive modeling to forecast customer purchasing behavior.

Improve the graphical representation of the data by incorporating interactive visualizations using Plotly or Power BI.
# __Conclusion__
This project demonstrates the ability to extract insights from large datasets using SQL and Python, integrating both for efficient data querying and graphical representation. The analysis offers valuable insights into customer and seller behavior, payment trends, and order patterns.
